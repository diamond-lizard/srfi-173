* SRFI 173: Hooks
** Abstract
This library describes a mechanism known as hooks. Hooks are a certain kind of extension point in a program that allows interleaving the execution of arbitrary code with the execution of the program without introducing any coupling between the two.

For more information see: [[https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-173/srfi-173.html][SRFI 173: Hooks]]
** Rationale
The use of hooks is pervasive in GNU Emacs and many other programs that offer some "plugin" mechanism that is built on top a facility similar to what this library offers.

While building programs, there is a need to offer extension points to allow the user to extend and customize the execution of the program in way that avoids coupling. This library wants to help with that.
** Specification
This specification describes one disjoint type called hook.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(make-hook arity)
#+END_SRC

Create a hook object for storing procedures of ARITY. The return value is a hook object.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(hook? obj)
#+END_SRC

Return #t if obj is a hook. Otherwise, it returns #f.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(list->hook arity lst)
#+END_SRC

Create a hook with the given procedures LST that must have an arity equal to ARITY. The return value is a hook object.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(list->hook! hook lst)
#+END_SRC

Replace procedures in HOOK by the procedures in LST. The return value is unspecified

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(hook-add! hook proc)
#+END_SRC

Add the procedure PROC to the HOOK object. The return value is not specified. An implementation may check that the arity of PROC is equal to the arity of the HOOK.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(hook-delete! hook proc)
#+END_SRC

Delete the procedure PROC from the HOOK object. The return value is not specified.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(hook-reset! hook)
#+END_SRC

Remove all procedures from the HOOK object. The return value is not specified.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(hook->list hook)
#+END_SRC

Convert the list of procedures of HOOK object to a list.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(hook-run hook . args)
#+END_SRC

Apply all procedures from HOOK to the arguments ARGS. The order of the procedure application is not specified. The return value is not specified. It is an error if the
length of ARGS is not equal to the arity of the HOOK object.

In a Scheme with invokable objects, hooks can invoked directly.
** Implementation Notes
The reference implementation from SRFI-173 was used verbatim, with the exception of a single call to =assume= from [[https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-145/srfi-145.html][SRFI 145]], which was replaced with =assert=.
